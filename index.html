I saw her in the rightest way  
Looking like Anne Hathaway  
Laughing while she hit her pen  
And coughed, and coughed  
And then, she came up to my knees  
Begging, baby, would you please?  
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me  


Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?  
And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?  
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior  
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor  
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong  
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long  
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long  


She took my fingers to her mouth  
The kind of thing that makes you proud  
That nothing else had ever  
Worked out, worked out  
And lately, I've tried other things  
But nothing can capture the sting  
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now  


Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?  
When you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?  
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior  
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor  
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong  
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long  
I sleep so that I can see you and I hate to wait so long  


And we can run away to the walls inside your house  
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse  
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about  
We can go forever until you wanna sit it out
